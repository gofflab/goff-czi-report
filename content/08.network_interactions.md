# Computational Tools Network Enhanced Interactions

• Increased collaborative interactions and shared trainees with Dr. Elana Fertig lab
	- Two groups cross training in experimental and computational single cell analysis

• Postdoctoral trainee Dr. Stein-O'Brien's participation in the Jamboree enabled fruitful discussion and code for projectR.

• Two collaboratively written publications with Dr. Elana Fertig
	- Release, description, and biological exploration of a comprehensive single cell RNA-seq dataset from the developing mouse retina
	- Introduction of scCoGAPS and ProjectR for latent space discovery across single cells and transfer learning across experiments.

• Interactions with CZI cellxgene development group Re: possible latent space visualizations
